# Tic-Tac-Toe - Python, JavaScript and React Versions

Hi there! I'm currently learning Python. This simple Tic-Tac-Toe game is one of my first projects after completing some YouTube tutorials to gain hands-on experience with the language. 

- `tictactoe.py` - The original version written in Python.
- `script.js` - A one-to-one JavaScript port of the Python version.
- `react-tictactoe` - A React version of script.js.

## Description
The JavaScript version is a direct translation of the original Python implementation.
The goal was to reproduce the game logic and structure as closely as possible using JavaScript syntax.

Both the Python and JavaScript versions are console-based and run in the terminal.
The React version is a browser-based implementation using state management.

For the React state management logic, I also experimented with using an LLM to guide me.
