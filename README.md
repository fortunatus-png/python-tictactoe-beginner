# Tic-Tac-Toe - Python and JavaScript Versions

Hi there! I'm currently learning Python. This simple Tic-Tac-Toe game is one of my first projects after completing some YouTube tutorials to gain hands-on experience with the language. 

- `tictactoe.py` - The original version written in Python.
- `script.js` - A one-to-one JavaScript port of the Python version.

## Description
The JavaScript version is a direct translation of the original Python implementation.
The goal was to reproduce the game logic and structure as closely as possible using JavaScript syntax.

Both versions are console-based and run in the terminal.
